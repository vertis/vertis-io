title: "The API Challenge"
---

One of my favorite finds this year is <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/">Programmable Web</a>, a site dedicated to APIs and Mashups that are the lifeblood of web 2.0. Having just watched the movie Julie &amp; Julia, which I highly recommend, I think that its only appropriate that I set myself a similar challenge. Take the top 50 apis, and within the next year develop a non trivial application for each of them (in no particular order). I've set myself a couple of rules:
<ul>
	<li>You are allowed to use any client libraries if they exist.</li>
	<li>Using multiple APIs in the one application is allowed (yay for mashup's)</li>
	<li>Any libraries/applications that are developed in the course of the challenge must have tests/specs and documentation.</li>
	<li>And of course blog about each api.</li>
</ul>
First up:
<ul>
	<li> API: Google Maps</li>
	<li>Deadline: Thursday the 29th of October</li>
</ul>
You'll be hearing from me soon. In the meantime I welcome anyone that wants to participate. Just leave a comment on this post, with your details. If it proves to be popular then I'll get some kind of signup/participant website going.
