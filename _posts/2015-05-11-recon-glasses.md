Google Glass taught me that Smart glasses can be just as cool as VR. In our efforts to keep up with a wide variety of emerging technologies, we got a pair of Recon Glasses.

 Unfortunately, I'm not super impressed with them. They've been hard to configure, and get the view right. They lack an easy ability to install and build new applications for them (not the first time I've had this kind of problem).

 Still interesting to see the field developing.
