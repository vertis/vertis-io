title: "Switching to RVM+REE+NGINX+Passenger"
---

<p>This is the second instalment of my attempt to do a daily post.</p>
<p>We&#39;re increasing the push toward the release, and I&#39;m now spending precious time looking into the why our Rails Stack is *leaking* workers. My initial research suggested that these workers could be sent a SIGABRT to get them to throw a stacktrace and exit - this hasn&#39;t worked however.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been planning to change from the current stack UbuntuProvidedRuby1.8.7+Apache+Passenger to RVM+REE+NGINX+Passenger for a while. With the prerequisite testing done that our app works with the new stack. I&#39;ve decided that rather than attack this problem head-on I&#39;ll use this opportunity to switch and then tackle the problem again if it shows up.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> After changing the stack it appears to have stopped *leaking* workers - that&#39;s a positive outcome to a problem I can&#39;t afford the time to look into in more detail. Additionally the before and after performance tests are in:</p>
