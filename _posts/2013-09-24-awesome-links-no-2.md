> Microduino:  Arduino in your pocket, small, stackable, smart

Awesome links for the 24th of September 2013:

[Pop!](http://popanyform.com/?v) - An awesome way to securely fill forms (Disclaimer: I've just started at Pop!)

[Analysis of NuoDB](http://aphyr.com/posts/292-call-me-maybe-nuodb) - Don't claim to have solved/refuted the CAP Theorem, you probably haven't

[Microduino](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/microduino/microduino-arduino-in-your-pocket-small-stackable) - Lots of potential applications for this Kickstarter project. Good collection of 'shields' as a starting point as well. I like my lazy electronics.
