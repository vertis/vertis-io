  title: "Foursquare"

Apparently the idea for my Google Maps API part of my challenge has already been done by <a href="http://foursquare.com/">foursquare</a>. Dammit, that was a good idea too. They've taken it to the next level as well, making it possible to complete badges (much like Stackoverflow and/or Kongregate). It's a bit limited, in that you can't have it in every city right now, but it should be fun to play with and might get a solid following from people with smartphones and people that love the whole geo-tagging phenomenon. Oh well, back to the drawing board, this was probably a bit complex for a week long project anyway.
