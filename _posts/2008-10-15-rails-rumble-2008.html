I’m participating in <a href="http://www.railsrumble.com/">Rails Rumble 2008</a> I got in a bit late because I only came across it the other day. I’m a bit of hermit when it comes to development so its a great idea participating in an event and getting to know some people. The project is currently top secret ;-) but once its finished I’ll open source it.

The other thing I’m going to try and do is record really closely the steps that I take during development. So I can post the videos as podcasts (ala railscasts), but also so I can go back and evaluate my own processes. I haven’t done anything like this in the past but if it goes well then maybe I’ll make it a regular thing.
