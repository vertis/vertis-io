title: "The difference between accidental and negligent"

<div class="mceTemp"></div>
I've finally moved out of the little apartment I had in Darlinghurst. It's one of those times when I wish that I'd had a car handy so that I could have loaded everything onto a trailer rather than having to pay a removal company. Not that I was desperate to move all the furniture myself.

Before the move I was quite happy at the thought of letting a removal company carry all our stuff down three flights of stairs. That was before <a href="http://www.morganremovals.com.au">Morgan Removals</a> damaged a bunch of stuff because they didn't strap my new 3 month old fridge in. They get to the other end, two-three suburbs over and the fridge is on a 45 degree angle, laying across everything in the middle. I was not impressed. Had I known then the extent of the damage I would not have paid them.

The front of the fridge now has scratches and dents that weren't there. The bed frame, one of the items that it fell on, is unusable, since it broke it in two. The most annoying part about the later damage, is that they snuck it into the house. Didn't bother to tell me that it had been destroyed, just quietly placed it in the bedroom, and left me to discover it when I went to put the bed together later that day.

When I contacted the company,  I was first palmed off on the driver, no response from the actual company. After two follow up emails, I was told that they weren't going to replace the broken items, stating:
<blockquote>"<span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">Unfortunately no responsibility can be taken from our side. On our confirmation letter we advise all our clients to visit our insurance page for all your insurance needs and it is your responsibility to take out  accidental cover or not, as all removal companies advise.</span></span>"</blockquote>
Accidental damage insurance is laughable, because the fact is that it wasn't an accident, the movers didn't bother to strap the fridge in. That's not accidental in my books, it's negligent. Before you ask, yes, I explained in detail to the customer service representative about the fridge not being strapped in and falling over.

I usually try to be rational and calm about these things, but they way they've treated my stuff, and their desire to lie and avoid responsibility is going to make me spend tomorrow leaving negative reviews on every site I can find.

If you live in Sydney and are looking for a removal company, then I would encourage you to steer clear of <a href="http://www.morganremovals.com.au">Morgan Removals</a>. I've included the pictures showing the damage for your information.
