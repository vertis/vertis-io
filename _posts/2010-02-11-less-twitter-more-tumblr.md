Edit: Ironically this is no longer on Tumblr :D

Recently I’ve been using a lot less twitter. Perhaps it’s just that I tend to be very verbose, but I struggle to put anything meaningful into 140 characters. Links to my blog posts are all well and good, but I’ve never been able to get on board with the torrent of retweets and mass link spamming.

Tumblr has an interface that allows me to post items that are longer than a tweet but lack the polish of what I’d expect to put in my Wordpress blog. It also allows sharing of links and other forms of media.

I’m not going to abandon twitter altogether, it’s still interesting to follow various different people, I just don’t feel that its as good a platform for interacting as its made out to be.
