I've promised myself that I'm going to do a lot of reading this year. To date I've done quite well, and the books have been amazing.

["How to Create a Mind" by Ray Kurzweil](http://www.amazon.com/How-Create-Mind-Thought-Revealed-ebook/dp/B007V65UUG) was an excellent read. It seemed a great idea to follow up with more AI books, I read two William Hertling novels, [Avogadro Corp](http://www.amazon.com/Avogadro-Corp-Singularity-Closer-Appears-ebook/dp/B006ACIMQQ) and [A.I. Apocalypse](http://www.amazon.com/I-Apocalypse-Singularity-William-Hertling-ebook/dp/B007FZVI2M). They were both great, but I enjoyed the second more.

Not that I have a heap of time for it, but reading ["How to Create a Mind" by Ray Kurzweil](http://www.amazon.com/How-Create-Mind-Thought-Revealed-ebook/dp/B007V65UUG) got me thinking about Machine Learning again. Today I stumbled upon (Machine Learning in Javascript)[http://burakkanber.com/blog/machine-learning-in-other-languages-introduction/], which is an interesting series of posts.
