title: "Setting up VMWare Server 2.0.2 on Ubuntu 9.10 x86_64"
---

It's been a while since I've had to setup VMWare Server. Officially only Ubuntu 8.04 is a supported platform from the Ubuntu line. Keeping that in mind, I started by installing VMWare Server on 8.04, just to get a feel for how the installation would go. It installed smoothly, and I had a working VMWare environment in ~10 minutes.
