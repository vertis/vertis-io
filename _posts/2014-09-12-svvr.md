The Silicon Valley VR meetup was an amazing event. And a fantastic chance to connect with companies that are in the space. Hopefully I'll get a chance to come back and see the people that make up this group more often.

And of course play with all the unreleased technology from everyone from Leap Motion to Samsung (Gear VR)
