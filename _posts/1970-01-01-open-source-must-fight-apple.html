title: "Open Source must fight Apple"

I know all you Rails coders love your Macbook Pros. I know that my Girlfriend is going to beat me over the head with her Macbook when I get home. I know that I'm listing to an iPod nano as I write this, but the moves that Apple are making are not friendly ones, their ones that go against the very tenets of open source.
