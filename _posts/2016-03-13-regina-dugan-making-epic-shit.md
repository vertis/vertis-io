Yet another brain dump.

[Regina Dugan - Making Epic Sh*t](http://schedule.sxsw.com/2016/events/event_PP91545) was probably my favourite talk at SXSW so far.

  - Credentials: DARPA + Google ATAP
  - Innovation is a discipline
  - Breakthrough vs Evolutionary Innovation
  - When operating at the level that DARPA/Google ATAP operate at failure is just a part of it - Said differently Breakthrough Innovation is going to involve failure.
  - Failure isn't the problem, fear of failure is the problem
  - [Pasteur's Quadrant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasteur's_quadrant) - Picking highly applicable technologies for which the science is now ready

The talk wasn't recorded but I did find a bunch of other Regina talks after:

The Google I/O talk is longer and potentially better (though slightly older).

An even older talk while Regina was still at DARPA is also interesting:
