title: "Twitter Game"
---

I've decided to play a fairly simple game on twitter. If you follow me, then I'll return the follow, i.e. I'll follow you (this will probably get me more than a few spam bots). As soon as I follow you the game begins. The basic premise, you get points for how long I follow you.

As soon as you do something that I find annoying -- you're out.  Such actions might include; linking to items that you find on &lt;insert social news site here&gt; constantly, constant chattering without thinking,  advertising products and/or anything else I deem particularly annoying.

I will let you know that you're out (regardless of whether you want me to or not). I will also put you in a hall of fame (if I ever get around to it). I will accept appeals, with relevant case argued or the equally funny begging and grovelling, I will NOT be accepting bribes at this time.

Finally sending an *auto* direct message when I follow you WOULD be a really bad idea if you wish to stay in the game (and the list of people I'm following)  for more that 5 minutes.

<strong>TO GET STARTED: Create an account at <a href="http://www.twitter.com">http://www.twitter.com</a> and follow <a href="http://www.twitter.com/vertis">@vertis</a></strong>
