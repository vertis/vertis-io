title: "Word of the Day: Resource"
---

This word can mean a lot of things. The reason its currently in my headspace is ongoing discussions/actions to do with the amount of resources that are devoted to the project that I’m currently working on. My background is one of just getting things done, I do things as quickly as possible and then move onto the next item on the list. This occasionally gets me into trouble as I overtax MY resources. Not only this but pushing to hard also causes my collegues issues.

At the end of the day you can only get so much done, feeling stressed all the time because you’re pushing to hard doesn’t necessarily help you get things done faster it just burns you out. So yeah, make sure that there are sufficient resources allocated to a project if you have to meet a given deadline, and if there isn’t then its important to talk to the client and make sure more resources are allocated.
