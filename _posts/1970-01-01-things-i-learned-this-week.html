<ul>
	<li>To read the tests before looking for other examples of how to accomplish something using  a library. Good tests for a library will help you grok the best way to do something. MongoMapper is a great example.</li>
	<li>You can't use date +%Y%m%d in a crontab, because % is a character that is converted to a newline. Either put it in a wrapper script, or escape using '\'. On ubuntu cron logs to /var/log/syslog, posts suggest that other distros may use /var/log/messages</li>
	<li>You can do a server upgrade of Ubuntu very easily:  'sudo apt-get install update-manager-core' and  'sudo do-release-upgrade', more details <a href="http://www.ubuntulinux.org/getubuntu/upgrading">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
