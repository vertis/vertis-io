title: "Why \"Mad Libs\" style signup forms are just a gimmick"
---

The last few days I've been seeing a few references to ["Mad Libs"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs). Confused, I quickly punched the term into Google and discovered that it was a reference to something we've all done at school, filling in the blanks in a sentence. A couple of sites, like [konigi](http://konigi.com/notebook/mad-libs-style-form-increases-conversion-25-40) and [webmonkey](http://www.webmonkey.com/2010/02/using-mad-libs-to-make-web-forms-more-fun/) had posts about [HuffDuffer](http://huffduffer.com/) using a ["Mad Libs"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs) style form as their sign up form. The question was raised by a few people as to whether this was good design.

[Luke Wroblewski](http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1007) (in collaboration with [Vast.com](http://vast.com)) did some research and came up with astounding results that the conversion ratio rose some <strong>25-40%</strong> when a Mad Libs style form was used. That's an impressive, butÂ <strong>meaningless</strong> number. Don't get me wrong, I'm very happy that [HuffDuffer](http://huffduffer.com/) has found something that works for them. But lets step back for a second and analyse why the results that [Vast.com](http://vast.com) got might be this way.

Here's a thought; maybe it's just because its a completely novel approach to a signup form. But can you really see this becoming the standard way to do signup forms? How long do you think it will be before this becomes more annoying than amusing? So quit jibber jabbering about how good it is and take a look at the long term picture. Mad Libs style forms are not something you can take and apply elsewhere with guaranteed results.

To be fair, I'm biased against filling in the blanks. I hated the premise at school and I will probably continue to hate the practice until it, or I, ceases to exist.
