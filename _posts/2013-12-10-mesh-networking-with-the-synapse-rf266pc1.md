One of the projects that I've been working on for quite a while is FGIS, which stands for Fire Ground Information System.

Australia gets some pretty nasty bushfires during the summer months. The people that fight these fires, both paid firefighters and volunteers, don't get much in the way of technology on the ground to help them. The basic tools for planning are radios and paper maps (sometimes mud maps). While the control center has really rich information about a given area, communicating that out to the field is very difficult.

At the Random Hacks of Kindness last year we were introduced to the problem owner, and our team has been persisting in building a system to allow firefighters to have access to digital maps and realtime location tracking of the trucks since.

Which is how I came to be playing with Mesh Networking. While it is not clear whether the Synapse SNAP will end up being used (max range). I spend sometime exploring the capabilities, and was reasonably impressed.

Each SNAP device runs an embedded cut down version of Python. Which makes for some amazing possibilites.
