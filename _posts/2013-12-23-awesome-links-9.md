Now that the end of year is upon us, it seems like an opportunity to get some reading done & work on a few small projects.
<!--more-->
I just finished [The Last Firewall by William Hertling](http://www.amazon.com/The-Last-Firewall-William-Hertling-ebook/dp/B00EEIGHDI), which was a very good read. I haven't read his previous two books, but I'll have to pick them up now. I partically liked the (brief) reference to a Puppen (half dog, half cat).

I've been dabbling a bit with [Golang](http://golang.org/). It's a fantastic language and I'll be spending more time learning it over the break.
