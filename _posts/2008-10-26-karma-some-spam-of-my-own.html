title: "Karma. Some spam of my own"
---

If you look down the page a bit you will notice that I was having a go at the beast forum for allowing spam to remain on the site for a while (its still there). I looked at my own blog today only to realise that I’d got spammy comments and not realised. I’ve now tightened the filtering and made it so that comments have to be moderated before posting, which is fine because I’m not exactly overflowing with comments. Anyway, I got the metaphysical slap on the hand for being uppity.

I guess I should be at least somewhat flattered that my blog has been found by someone, even if that someone just wants to write meaningless garbage in my comments.
