>  Pebble Smartwatch

In a special edition of 'Awesome Links' I share what you should be buying your nerdy friends for Christmas (assuming they haven't already bought it for themselves)

We may all use smartphones for everything now, but if you asked the futurists of the 1980s what we would be using now, they probably have described something like [Pebble](https://getpebble.com/). This Smartwatch took Kickstarter by storm, and continues to impress. At USD$150 it may fit into your budget for a loved one.

For all those geeks with kids, the [Leap Motion](https://www.leapmotion.com/) is the perfect gift. There is nothing quite like watching a kid discover magic. And at USD$79 it has a much better time to entertainment ration than the movie gift voucher you were thinking of giving them.
