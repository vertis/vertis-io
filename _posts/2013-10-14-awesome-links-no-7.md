[Cypherpunks 2.0](http://adi.is/s/cpunk20) - Interesting talk by Andy Isaacson from Noisebridge. Videos are split into a bunch of sections [Part 1](http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/39791560/highlight/423948), [Part 2](http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/39791773/highlight/423949) & [Q & A](http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/39791773/highlight/423954)

[Spark Core](https://www.spark.io/) - This tiny embedded board looks very promising. Originally a [Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sparkdevices/spark-core-wi-fi-for-everything-arduino-compatible) campaign. Delivery is currently behind schedule. Most importantly though, it's an open hardware project.

[redecentralize.org](http://redecentralize.org/) - The site seems to be just getting started, but already contains some excellent interviews from people working on projects to "take back control of the internet". Well worth the time to watch.
