After switching to the Google Pixel, I've found myself using 'Ok Google' more and more. Particularly when it comes to actions like setting reminders, and events and navigating.

This is a list of things I wished worked, in no particular order, with dates attached so I can record when they do start working.

## Notes
  * Some of these things are limitations of the assistant, and some of them are limitations of the application
  * It possible some of these already work and I just don't know how to access them. Though that is itself a failure. Discovery should be easy.

## April 2017
  * Take a note  - Says I don't have a note app installed
  * Navigate to X (decides that I want to walk regardless of how far). "Navigate to X by car" works, but it should be more intelligent about what it suggests as the default.
  * Navigation: Toggle the toll roads / no toll roads per trip, rather than as a global setting in the navigation app. While 'Navigate without tolls' works
  * Send a Telegram message
  * Send a Whatsapp message
  * Set an all-day event (The flow can only handle 'one hour' meetings)
