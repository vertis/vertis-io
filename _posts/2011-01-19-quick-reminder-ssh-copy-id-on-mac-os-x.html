title: "Quick Reminder: ssh-copy-id on Mac OS X"
---

<p>Mac OS X for some reason lacks the ssh-copy-id shell script. You can install ssh-copy-id on Mac OS X using either &#39;homebrew&#39; or &#39;macports&#39;. Since it is a fairly trivial script you could also choose to copy it from various sources manually.</p>

	e.g:</p>
<p>[gist id=785723]curl https://github.com/beautifulcode/ssh-copy-id-for-OSX/ssh-copy-id.sh -o /usr/local/bin/ssh-copy-id chmod +x /usr/local/bin/ssh-copy-id [/gist]</p>
