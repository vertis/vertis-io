Prep time: 0:30
Cook time: 0:10
Skill level: Low
Serves: 4-6

## Ingredients

### Noodles:
Vegetable or peanut oil
2 stalks celery, finely diced
300g swiss brown or button mushrooms, finely diced
1 clove garlic, finely chopped
150g Chinese broccoli (gai lan), trimmed at the base or cut into 5cm pieces
450g fresh noodles, such as hokkien or rice noodles, or egg noodles (for non-vegan version)
1 Tbsp sesame seeds, toasted
Handful of coriander leaves
3-2 spring onions, finely chopped
Sea salt
White pepper
Szechuan or regular chilli oil, to serve

### Dan dan sauce:

20g fresh ginger, about 5cm, peeled and finely chopped
2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
3 Tbsp rice vinegar
3 Tbsp tamari or soy sauce
2 Tbsp Szechuan or regular chilli oil
1 tsp sesame oil
1/3 cup (80ml) tahini, or peanut butter as a substitute
3 tsp sugar
Pinch sea salt

## Method

1.  1.In a small bowl, add the ingredients for the sauce and whisk to combine.
2.  2.Bring a big pot of salted water to the boil. Add the noodles and cook according to packet instructions until al dente, about 3-4 minutes. Drain and rinse under cold water.
3.  3.In a large pan or wok over medium-high heat, drizzle about one tablespoon of oil, add the celery and cook until softened, about 2 minutes. Add the mushrooms and garlic, season with a big pinch of sea salt, a small pinch of white pepper, and cook for 4-5 minutes until the mushrooms are golden and starting to caramelise. Remove from pan and set aside.
4.  4.Heat the same wok/pan, and when hot, add small drizzle of oil and toss in the Chinese broccoli. Toss for 1 minute or so, until the broccoli is bright green. Remove from pan immediately so they don't discolour.
5.  5.Place the noodles in a large bowl and add the mushroom mixture and sauce. Toss to combine, making sure the noodles are well coated. To serve, top with the Chinese broccoli, and scatter with sesame seeds, coriander and spring onions. If you like it spicy, drizzle with more chilli oil.
