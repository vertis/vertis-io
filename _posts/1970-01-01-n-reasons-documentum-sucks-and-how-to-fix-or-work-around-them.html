title: "n reasons Documentum sucks, and how to fix(or work around) them"
---

<ol>
	<li>The logging is terrible - the sheer amount of logfiles for different services &amp; the different directories that the log files end up in. Logfile rotation, and the pattern (lack of date) in a lot of the log files all add up to make it a big 0/10</li>
	<li>There are lots of errors that get thrown by documentum. E.g DM_SESSION_E_RPC_ERR, searching on powerlink should return a result for every single one of them. This one for instance didn't return a result. A quick reference that deals with what to do when you see any given error would be immensely helpful</li>
	<li>Patching or upgrading components is not straight forward. Regression is a big problem.</li>
	<li>Shear amount of different components (and matching documentation), makes it difficult to find answers to problems and or reference valid information. Powerlink does not help.</li>
	<li>Lack of cooperation from EMC Support and Engineers</li>
	<li>Resource Hog.</li>
</ol>
