Awesome links for the 8th of October 2013:

[Dashing (by Shopify)](http://shopify.github.io/dashing/) - Easy to use dashboard building goodness

[Rickshaw Graphs](http://code.shutterstock.com/rickshaw/) - I wasn't aware that shutterstock contributed to open source, until I stumbled across this graphing library in [Dashing (by Shopify)](http://shopify.github.io/dashing/). It uses D3 under the hood, but provides a simple interface for the more common graphs (with bells and whistles).

[Big list of D3 examples](http://christopheviau.com/d3list/gallery.html) - Speaking of D3, this popped up on Hacker News this morning. I find when making graphs, having a wealth of examples is the easiest way to get started.

[Polymaps](http://polymaps.org/) - I'm sure that I've seen Polymap before, but I ran across it again this morning. Will have to have a play with it one evening.
