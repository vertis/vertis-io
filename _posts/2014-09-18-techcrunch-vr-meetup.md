My visit to the US just keeps getting more and more surreal. Tomorrow is the start of Oculus Connect, tonight however I'm attending the Techcrunch VR meetup.

More talking than demoing, though it's a good chance to get to know some of the people in the community. There was at least one interesting alternative VR headset in the [MergeVR](https://mergevr.com).

You can sort of see it (terrible photo):

Darknet (as seen in the feature image above) was pretty interesting as well.
