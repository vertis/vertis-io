  <h1>My Post-PRISM checklist</h1>
</div>
<p>As an Australian, i.e. Non-US-Resident Non-US-Citizen, I've decided to take certain actions to change my online behaviours after recent events. While I have nothing of particular interest in my site usage/cloud/servers, I feel like the behaviour of the US government should not be ignored, and since US companies must to comply with US laws, regardless of what they say they cannot be deemed safe.</p>

<p><strong>WHY: Edward Snowden via The Guardian leaked numerous documents, including information about the PRISM program which suggests there is extensive surveillance and interception of foreign citizens' data without a court order.</strong></p>
