title: "It's easy to be unoriginal in the blogosphere"
---

hadn’t really noticed it until recently but I was reading a post on<a href="http://www.rubyinside.com/"> RubyInside</a> about <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/">RubyMine</a> - a preview release of a Rails IDE by the people that brought IntelliJ IDEA to the java IDE market. Later on the same day I googled RubyMine and discovered much to my surprise that there was now a multitude of other blog posts out there about the same topic. Its all very well to want to share this type of information but it gets a bit tedious reading the same thing over and over and over. If you’re not the first person to share the information in a given community at least have the sense to make sure that you’re blog post is different to the last one.
