This will be my second year [documenting](/2014/01/01/things-i-want-to-do-this-year.html) things that I want to do this year and giving myself a mark on the [results](/2015/01/01/scorecard-for-2014.html). I found it to be a valuable exercise last year, though my priorities did shift over the course of the year.
