title: "Dark and empty"
---

The room is empty except for a desk and a chair. I walk across and unpack my laptop, setting it up on the desk and plugging it into the power. I haven't even swept the place yet, or replaced the blown light globe. It has the dusty feel of a place that hasn't been used in quite a while.

There is power but no phone or internet, so its just as well that I have a couple of 3g cards hanging around from my work. The apartment is not the nicest place that I've ever lived but it has the benefit of being close to the city.
About the only thing that I'll definately *have* to have to make the apartment habitable is an airconditioner.Â  I am definately not fond of the hot summers that cook Sydney. My first love affair with air conditioning came when I'd just started high school and we moved to the country town of Mildura, VIC. Its a farming town at the tip of Victoria, right before where the Darling River joins the Murray.

As towns went I didn't hate Mildura, of course I had the internet for the very first time in Mildura so maybe that puts it up there on the list of place i've lived. I digress, Mildura bakes in the dry heat that only a place on the edge of the desert can. EVERY house has an airconditioner, they don't make them without the big box on top.

The heat will burn you to a crisp out there, so having somewhere to escape after walking home from school is what made me appreciate air conditioning.

I have to go out. I'll tell you more later.
