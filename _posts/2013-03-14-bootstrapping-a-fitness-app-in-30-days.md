*Update: I've since stopped working on StriveHQ, however I believe in the permaweb, so I'll leave this posted here*

A little while ago, I decided that the best use for my Annual Leave would be to spend time writing an application.

Let me rewind a little. 

I'm a big fan of [Amy Hoy](http://unicornfree.com/ "Unicorn Free"), and while I don't have thousands of dollars to invest in her 30x500 course, her message about building a sustainable business seeped into my consciousness.

There were so many other influences that it's almost impossible to list them all, but 37signal's [Getting Real](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0578012812/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0578012812&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=strve-20) & [Rework](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002MUAJ2A/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B002MUAJ2A&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=strve-20), and [The Lean Startup](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307887898/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0307887898&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=strve-20) by Eric Ries all come to mind.

So here I am. I have approximately 1 month of leave saved up, and I've decided to do an application to help personal trainers. Today is first official day of my one month *runway*.

The skeleton of my application already done -- I got excited after I first decided to work on the project. It goes without saying really, that I have bunch amount of development work to get done to get to an MVP.

I'm going to try to do this in as lean a way as possible. Which will be challenging, because I've got to work out how to engage with a beta group of personal trainers.

I'm planning to use this blog to document my progress along the way.
