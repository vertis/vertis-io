title: "Technoweenie & Josh Grobel - why do you not care?"
---

I first posted over two months ago about the fact that I’d been digging around in Rails forum software and discovered that <a href="http://beast.caboo.se/">beast.caboo.se</a> was loaded with spam. I notified both of them via email, while I recieved a reply from Josh, over 2 months later and still nothing has been done about the spam. Beast has now been replaced by ’<a href="http://github.com/courtenay/altered_beast/tree/master">Altered Beast</a>’ as the forum to use (since Beast is pre rails 2.0). Never the less <a href="http://beast.caboo.se/">the official beast forum</a> still shows up high in the search rankings on google.

Whatever respect I had for <a href="http://www.workingwithrails.com/person/5337-josh-goebel">Josh Grobel</a> and <a href="http://weblog.techno-weenie.net/">Rick Olsen aka Technoweenie</a> is now gone. Josh argued that the forum isn’t used anymore. My response to that would be to delete the spam and lock the forums so you don’t have to deal with it anymore. I know everyone is on limited time, but it clearly reflects badly on them when sex sites are advertised on their forums and yet they do nothing about it.

Why don’t they care? 15 minutes of one of their time and the problem would be gone.
