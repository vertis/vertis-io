Xmas is fast approaching again and it's been on my mind to share a few of the things that I have found valuable as a Digital Nomad and Indie Hacker.

## Aeropress Go
In the time that I've been a digital nomad, I've owned both the original Aeropress, and more recently the Aeropress Go. While both are excellent sources of portable coffee, the former just didn't pack well. 

The Aeropress Go fits much better in a backpack. It still seems to be designed for short trips, the little plastic coffee cover, is not even remotely useful when you're carrying all the filters around with you. The stirring tool seems to be completely over engineered as well. I've never beeen able to work out why they though it was necessary to have the folding bit. 

Even with these flaws it's still an excellent addition to your digital nomad carry. It makes for a reliable source of caffeine, which is useful because coffee quality can vary widely depending on the regions you're visiting.

## HyperJuice GaN 100W USB-C Charger
I backed the kickstarter for this product, and aside from missing their deadlines a little when the pandemic started the product delivers what it promised. It is possible to use 2 laptops off it, particularly if you're not doing anything too intensive. Plus I can charge an assortment of test devices at the same time.

It is both smaller and lighter than the 87W Macbook USB-C charger that came with my 2018 Macbook. It comes with US/UK/EU and AU plug types, which is handy when you're moving from country to country.

## Zero to Sold by Arvid Kahl
My favourite non-fiction book of the year, definitely goes to Arvid Kahl's Zero to Sold. So many startup books are from VC's that are looking to pat themselves on the back, rather than being real in-the-trenches views of starting a a startup.

While it's not strictly a digital-nomad product, it can be difficult to get packages to your favourite digital nomad, so buying them a digital gift this Xmas might be a good alternative.
