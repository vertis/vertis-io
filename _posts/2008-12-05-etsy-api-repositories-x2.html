title: "Etsy Api repositories x2"
---

For those that are interested I’ve decided to release the work I did on accessing information from <a href="http://www.etsy.com/">etsy</a>’s backend. I have two copies one that is a ruby gem and based on a custom hacked rubyamf implementation (since it doesn’t support being a client) and one written in PHP that relies on SabreAMF (the copy that I gave to juln and that runs the heartomatic), and put that up as well. The url you want for my new code is:

<a href="http://www.github.com/vertis/etsy_api">http://www.github.com/vertis/etsy_api</a>

And the one for my old (possibly broken) php code is:

<a href="http://www.github.com/vertis/etsy_api-php">http://www.github.com/vertis/etsy_api-php</a>

If people are interested in collaborating on these projects let me know (sign up for github) and I’ll see about adding you.
