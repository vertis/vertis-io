A recent chance encounter on Hacker News with the creator of SingleFile, a Firefox extension I frequently use, reminded me that I had been meaning to write about how it forms part of my knowledge workflow. It was also an opportunity to express gratitude for an amazing open source extension.

The SingleFile Extension has a number of features, but at its core, as the name suggests, it allows downloading a webpage and encapsulating it into a single file. The extension does so much more than that though. Amongst the many options is the ability to upload the file to a git repository. It also allows turning on an 'Infobar' that links back to the original web page.

Each new addition to the repository triggers a deployment of a static site to Vercel. I could have stored this directly into my Obsidian repo, but I wanted try to maintain the external nature of this content.

Every few days I review the content that's been added, I'm no expert here, but I try to extract pieces and add them to my existing notes and/or create new notes. This stage is crucial for distilling information, extracting key insights, and incorporating them into a broader knowledge system. 

Earlier versions of my process tried to capture this content in Markdown and included it directly into Obsidian. This had the downside of including a bunch of undistilled content into the knowledge base and made searching through *MY* notes much more difficult. Keeping the pages accessible in a permanent web, while at the same time external to my Obsidian seems like the right compromise.

This workflow is a work in progress, it's a vast improvement on my previous workflow, but I'm always open to improvements.

## Aside: Supporting Open Source

Interacting with the creator of SingleFile was not just about expressing thanks; it's a reminder of how individual contributions can significantly enhance our digital experiences. I went off to find the donation page. I don't do that enough.
