title: "Review: Data Source Handbook by Peter Warden (O'Reilly)"
---

<p>When a post about the <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/0636920018254/">Data Source Handbook</a> came through my RSS reader today I was excited. I&#39;ve used quite a few webservices, and follow <a href="http://programmableweb.com">programmableweb</a>&nbsp;closely, so a book about APIs is exactly what I was interested in reading. Later in the evening I caved and bought the ebook version -&nbsp;I should have looked more closely.</p>
<p>At 39 pages I would consider the $7.50 I paid (thanks retailmenot) to be more than the *book* is worth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/0636920018254/">Data Source Handbook</a> is not substantive, and shares little more than a single request to each of the services it covers, and where to signup for an api key.&nbsp;Don&#39;t get me wrong, Peter Warden has obviously spent quite a bit of time using the different services, as evidenced by his github project(<a href="https://github.com/petewarden/findbyemail">https://github.com/petewarden/findbyemail</a>).&nbsp;The level of detail just didn&#39;t impress me.</p>
<p>The book is organised by the categories of the different webservices; Websites, People by Email, People by Name, People by Account, Search Terms, Locations, Companies, IP Addresses, and Products(Books, Films, Music, etc).</p>
<p>Of the 54 APIs covered, I&#39;d used about half already. Which wouldn&#39;t be a problem if the coverage of these APIs had any depth.</p>
<p>All in all, if you&#39;re looking for an advanced and substantive book on APIs...this isn&#39;t it.</p>
