So many thoughts about Oculus Connect 2.

The theme for the event is definitely revealed by the inclusion of Ready Player One in all the conference bags. I've long since read it (as I suspect have most here).
Facebook definitely foresees a world where everyone interacts in an environment similar to Oasis.

It's sooo much bigger than last year, and so much more serious. There are a lot of attendees that come from bigger companies now (particularly game studios), and it didn't feel that way last year.
