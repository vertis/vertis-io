So many thoughts about Oculus Connect 2.

Facebook definitely foresees a world where everyone interacts in an environment similar to Oasis.

It's sooo much bigger than last year, and so much more serious. There are a lot of attendees that come from bigger companies now (particularly game studios), and it didn't feel that way last year.
