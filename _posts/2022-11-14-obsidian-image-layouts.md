# Enhancing Note Visuals with Obsidian Image Layouts

As an enthusiast of note-taking and knowledge management, I'm pleased to share a new addition to the Obsidian ecosystem - the [**Obsidian Image Layouts**](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian-image-layouts) plugin. This tool is a response to the need for a more structured and aesthetically pleasing way to incorporate images into Obsidian notes. For more details, check out the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/vertis/obsidian-image-layouts).

## Purpose of Obsidian Image Layouts:

The core idea behind Obsidian Image Layouts is simple: to offer a straightforward way to enhance the visual aspect of notes. It's designed to cater to those who often use images in their notes and seek a more organized and visually engaging layout.

## Features at a Glance:

1. **Multiple Layout Templates:** Including image-layout-a, image-layout-b, etc., each designed to offer a distinct visual presentation for images in your notes.
2. **Support for Various Image Formats:** Accommodates both local (wikilink format) and remote images (URL format), providing flexibility in sourcing visuals.
3. **Intelligent Image Handling:** The plugin smartly manages scenarios of image overflow or shortage, maintaining the aesthetics of your notes.
4. **Experimental Masonry Layouts:** A new addition to offer a dynamic, modern visual presentation.

For a complete list including visual examples, check out the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/vertis/obsidian-image-layouts).

## Roadmap and Future Enhancements:

I plan to expand the plugin's capabilities, with features on the horizon such as overlaying text on images, adding captions, introducing a general photo gallery, and improving user interaction with drag-and-drop functionality and layout selection tools. Keep an eye on our [GitHub page](https://github.com/vertis/obsidian-image-layouts) for updates.

## Finally:

Obsidian Image Layouts is only tiny a beginning. I'm excited to see how it evolves and how it's used. I look forward to your thoughts and how you integrate Obsidian Image Layouts into your note-taking workflows. Your feedback is invaluable. Suggestions for new layouts, feature enhancements, and contributions are always welcome and appreciated.
