It seems we always have a new toy to play with. This time it's attaching the leap motion to the front of the DK2 to play with how interaction using your hands my work.

After building a prototype, and putting quite a few users through some testing we discovered just how uncomfortable it is for users when the tracking screws up. It's extremely disconcerting to see your hands at an odd angle.

In addition to the comfort factors, it's surprising how often you turn your head without your hands following (resulting in a loss of tracking).
