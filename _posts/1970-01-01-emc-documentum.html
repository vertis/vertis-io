title: "EMC Documentum"

There are times I love Documentum and then there are days that I curse the Engineers that created it. Such is the life of a person in my role. Right now I'm loving the fact that a simple comment I made on twitter got a response offering to investigate. This post is a response to that since trying to communicate a long winded technical issue on twitter would be an abuse of the medium.

For those that don't follow my <a href="http://www.twitter.com/vertis">twitterfeed</a>, I had made a brief comment about fixing a major bug/oversight in the next version of your product not being an acceptable decision at an enterprise level.
<blockquote><span class="status-body"><span class="entry-content">At an enterprise level fixing a bug in the next version is not an acceptable outcome. I'm looking at you EMC/Documentum</span></span></blockquote>
<span class="status-body"><span class="entry-content">The bug I was talking about right at that second was actually to do with an error being thrown regarding there being to many acls.  As it turns out EMC has already backported a hotfix for the issue in question. My feelings about the matter went back to the fact that I'd discovered a few months previouslythat BOCS and DTS/CTS are not supported in the same environment( in 6.0SP1). I'd raised a case to clarify the matter and the severity of the problem considering the fact that the production DTS server was less stable than I would have liked. They investigated and reported that it was indeed true that  BOCS and DTS/CTS are not supported in the same configuration in 6.0SP1, though they assured me that it was not a major problem.</span></span>

<span class="status-body"><span class="entry-content">The above incompatibility when distilled is simple, BOCS by design asynchronously sends the content to the content server. If you've got the environment set up to automatically rendition imported content (which we don't) OR a user straight away tries to kick off that process manually (they were), then the rendition server goes looking for content that isn't actually there yet. </span></span>

<span class="status-body"><span class="entry-content">The above all seems like a fairly minor problem, until you get users complaining that their PDF renditions don't work. All of a sudden you have wasted support hours, a measurable cost of the system not behaving well. This is to put aside for a second that the server is unexplainably unstable.</span></span>

<span class="status-body"><span class="entry-content">The setup with both BOCS and DTS/CTS was Architected by EMC. You could argue that they only found out the two didn't play nicely after the solution was implemented, and this may be the case, but our side is still left holding the bag.
