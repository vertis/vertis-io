[Getting started with Django](http://gettingstartedwithdjango.com/) - Clear and helpful videos/text for getting started with Django. Helped me gain at least a little bit of an understanding of django over the weekend.

[Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/) - Great way of learning (or brushing up, like me) on your python skills.

[Crispy Forms](https://github.com/maraujop/django-crispy-forms) - Crispy Forms is to Django, what Simple Forms is to Rails.
