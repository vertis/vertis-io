title: "An Exercise in Patience OR Enterprise consulting"

Document management was something that I had very little understanding of when I walked into the interview over a year ago now. They didn't expect me to know anything about it, I was being interviewed for my development and consulting skills. If I knew little about document management, I knew less about consulting.

Don't get me wrong I'd worked for myself before, running my own general IT consultancy and billing myself out. But the clients that I'd dealt with were small to medium size businesses. Enterprise as a rule doesn't like sole traders, there is to much risk of them being sick or dropping off the charts, so I'd not dealt with anything near the size of the businesses that my new employers dealt with. Consequently I knew a lot less about consulting than I thought I knew.

Enterprise is a funny beast, as a consultant to small businesses I was in the habit of solving all the problems myself as quickly as they came in. Very shoot from the hip Console Cowboy. The place that I'm working at the moment is actually pretty relaxed when it comes to IT. I know from discussing with the other consultants that there are times as an outsider (or even an insider) where you make no progress whatsoever because of bureaucracy.

Even though they're laid back I was not prepared to deal with the amount of red tape that has to be cut to get things done.

<strong>Enterprise is a slow moving beast</strong> - don't expect to get anything done near as fast as you want to.Â  The managers that you'll deal with on a given project may want things instantly, but they'll also know that realistically that isn't possible. In a big project like installing a content management system there are far more things to worry about than just the technical issues. One of the reasons that they have to move so slowly is that change management is more than just a buzzword. You move too quickly and don't check all the boxes, inform and consult with the right people and your project may very well be headed for failure. Every individual that the project touches has their opinion about the project, though some matter more than others.

If you do find yourself working on a large project factor in the fact that it will take a lot longer than you think possible to get all your ducks in a row.

<strong>They know they're important - </strong>and while they may not be shoving it in your face, you can expect this to be a factor in a couple of ways. Firstly they command a lot more respect when it comes to vendors than smaller businesses. This is logical, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to work out that as a vendor you'd have to be very stupid to not ask how high to jump when one of your biggest customers says so. It does make dealing with their support or getting patches out of their engineering department a lot more likely than if you have a few hundred employees.

<strong>Reporting and Metrics are key</strong>

I can't highlight the fact that if you're not measuring it doesn't exist. The example that most easily highlights this is an annecdote that I've heard passed
