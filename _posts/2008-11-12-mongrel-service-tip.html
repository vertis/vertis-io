title: "Mongrel service tip"
---

If you’re running rails applications on Windows then you’ll be interested in or already use the mongrel_service gem. When I recently (today) tried to install it on a new computer I had trouble because it didn’t want to install the dependencies. Apparently it requires a version of the win32-service gem &gt;= 0.5.2 but &lt; 0.6.0
<div class="CodeRay">
<pre>Microsoft Windows XP [Version 5.1.2600] (C) Copyright 1985-2001 Microsoft Corp.  C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator&gt;gem install win32-service -v 0.5.2 C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator&gt;gem install mongrel_service</pre>
</div>
should do the trick

<strong>UPDATE: </strong>Apparently using w32-service causes problems whenever you have defined a class named service. Just be aware that its going to cause it to use w32-services service class rather than you’re own, regardless of whether you’re running mongrel as a service (it won’t happen if you don’t run mongrel).
