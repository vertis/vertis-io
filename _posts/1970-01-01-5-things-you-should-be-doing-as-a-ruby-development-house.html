title: "5 things you should be doing as a ruby development house"
---

<p>To understand how and why I came up with the list below you need to know the back story, please bear with me.</p>
<p>I get contacted every other week about Ruby opportunities, and I&#39;m grateful for that. Recently a recruiter contacted me with the usual spiel - &nbsp;rapidly growing Rails Consultancy in Sydney/Melbourne, 50-60 staff, committed to agile practices. Okay I&#39;ll bite.</p>
<p>After doing a phone interview with her, I managed to extract the name of the company. When I did, I found that I was already familiar with the company, and not in a good way.&nbsp;The company in question shall remain nameless, but suffice it to say that I was not impressed. The recruiter tried to pressure me into proceeding with an interview with the company, and wanted reasons that I wouldn&#39;t proceed. I gave her a list of things that weren&#39;t up to scratch.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve refactored that list into a list of things you should be doing, and here it is.</p>
<p>1. Open Source</p>
<p>We work with a language that is open source, and use plugins/frameworks that are open source. It shouldn&#39;t need to be said that your company should be contributing to this ecosystem. That isn&#39;t the end of it though, you have to publicize your contributions, make it obvious that your company has time allocated to support the community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>People need to use the plugins/gems you&#39;ve created for them to become popular. A gem or plugin that everybody uses creates contact between you and the rest of the community, and fosters respect by potential candidates. Let&#39;s face it, if I&#39;ve never used anything that your company has produced then why should I be excited by what you say you do.</p>
<p>Shining Examples: Entp, Thoughtbot, Mocra (and many others)</p>
<p>2. Community Involvement</p>
<p>Two of things that I slammed the afore mentioned company about, was the lack of participation in the local monthly rails events, and not participating in events like Rails Rumble.</p>
<p>All of these rules go hand in hand, but to connect it back to the previous point, Rails Meetups and events like Rails Rumble raise the profile of your company in the Rails community. Coming along to the meetups in force, presenting at the meetups, even buying beer for people at the meetups all serves to connect you to the people that you&#39;re trying to recruit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even forgetting the fact that rails development houses are sourcing candidates from a currently limited pool, if you come to these events you will LEARN. If you learn something, and share something then the whole community benefits. If the community benefits, then it can offer better services to the wider public. More profile for Rails as a framework of choice for the public is good for you.</p>
<p>Do I need to draw a diagram?</p>
<p>3. Passion &amp; Dedication</p>
<p>Rails Rumble. </p>
<p>Just about every Development/Design company I&#39;ve seen the website of has a projects/portfolio section, good. But the broader public doesn&#39;t care about that project you did that they&#39;ll never use. The projects that come from Rails Rumble are cool toys that not only demonstrate your abilities, but also your passion.</p>
<p>4 Social Presence</p>
<p>5. Web Presence</p>
<p>If you are going to run a Rails consultancy, then I expect your website to pop. I expect it to compare to some of your peers in the industry. Most importantly, it should highlight</p>
