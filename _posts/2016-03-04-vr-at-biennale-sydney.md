Recently visited Cockatoo Island in Sydney for the 20th Annual Biennale. Plenty of great artworks, however the VR installation was my favourite. It was quite a basic implementation (not even using head tracking). Even without the advanced features I'm now used to the effect of pulling yourself forward down a tunnel while a display was strapped to your head was surreal.
