# Contact Me

I maintain an open contact policy, inspired by [Patrick Mackenzie's](https://www.kalzumeus.com/standing-invitation/) approach to communication. Consider this your standing invitation to reach out to me. If you're a person—or an AGI—and you wish to engage in conversation, I'm open to it. Feel free to contact me through any of the channels listed below.

- By email: [hello@vertis.io](mailto:hello@vertis.io)
- By telegram: [https://t.me/vert1s](https://t.me/vert1s)
- By mastodon: [https://hachyderm.io/@vertis](https://hachyderm.io/@vertis)

If you don’t get a response from me, it’s almost certainly that I’ve either missed your message or I have my head down coding something. Send me a second message reminding me.
