<h2><a href="/2011/02/01/review-data-source-handbook-by-peter-warden-o-reilly-.html">Review: Data Source Handbook by Peter Warden (O'Reilly)</a></h2>
<p>When a post about the <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/0636920018254/">Data Source Handbook</a> came through my RSS reader today I was excited. I&#39;ve used quite a few webservices, and follow <a href="http://programmableweb.com">programmableweb</a>&nbsp;closely, so a book about APIs is exactly what I was interested in reading. Later in the evening I caved and bought the ebook version -&nbsp;I should have looked more closely.</p>
<p>At 39 pages I would consider the $7.50 I paid (thanks retailmenot) to be more than the *book* is worth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/0636920018254/">Data Source Handbook</a> is not substantive, and shares little more than a single request to each of the services it covers, and where to signup for an api key.&nbsp;Don&#39;t get me wrong, Peter Warden has obviously spent quite a bit of time using the different services, as evidenced by his github project(<a href="https://github.com/petewarden/findbyemail">https://github.com/petewarden/findbyemail</a>).&nbsp;The level of detail just didn&#39;t impress me.</p>
<p>The book is organised by the categories of the different webservices; Websites, People by Email, People by Name, People by Account, Search Terms, Locations, Companies, IP Addresses, and Products(Books, Films, Music, etc).</p>
<p>Of the 54 APIs covered, I&#39;d used about half already. Which wouldn&#39;t be a problem if the coverage of these APIs had any depth.</p>
<p>All in all, if you&#39;re looking for an advanced and substantive book on APIs...this isn&#39;t it.</p>

<p><strong>Update: I received an awesome reply from Danielle this morning. It addressed the source of my frustration by indicating that they&#39;d look into changing the campaign. They&#39;re hardly going to completely change the email marketing just because I don&#39;t like it, but at least they&#39;ve registered my reaction in their decision making process. </strong></p>
<p><strong>The most awesome thing is that they really are listening at Twilio (which is what the emails claimed).&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>One more thing -- I&#39;m now looking forward to having a drink with Danielle when I get across to the US next :-)</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: small;">Hi *Danielle*,</span></p>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: small;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Can I just start by saying that it&#39;s rude and misleading to put a &#39;RE:&#39; on an email that is not a reply to a discussion we had earlier. Were this a real email (and not some campaign to get my attention) you may have noted that I have previously corresponded and asked about whether it was possible to send faxes. One of your staff members helpfully replied, though not Jeff Lawson despite the fact that the email that prompted that response was purportedly from him.</span></div>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: small;"><br />
	</span></div>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: small;">One wonders why you send these emails at all. You&#39;d have to figure most developers you going to see through the facade of claiming the email is from someone *important* when in reality it is just spam. I use spam in the loose sense of the word, sure I signed up for your service, and sure there is an unsubscribe link at the bottom, but why should I have to unsubscribe? How could I have known you would send me emails if I didn&#39;t start using your service fast enough?</span></div>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: small;"><br />
	</span></div>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: small;">I expect, since this reply will go to the helpdesk, it will be someone other than you that replies -- Which is sad because I was hoping to get to know you better. Maybe you, Jeff and I can have a drink next time I come to the US.</span></div>

										<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: small;">I wanted to drop a note to see how your experience with Twilio has been going. I see you&#39;ve had a play around, and I hope you were impressed with how easy building voice and SMS applications can be using Twilio.</span></p>
										<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: small;">I also wanted to offer some tips and tricks that other Twilio customers have found useful, and answer some frequent questions new developers have:</span></p>
										<h3><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: small;">Develop in Your Browser</span></h3>
										<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: small;">The usual first step to testing a web app is to load it in your browser, and see if it looks right, make sure there are no errors, etc. Right? That&#39;s also the easiest way to start developing a Twilio app... build and test in your browser! Load up your application&#39;s URL in your browser, and check to see that it&#39;s returning valid, error-free XML. Using an XML validating browser, such as Firefox, is really helpful. You can also simulate input to your web app that are normally generated by Twilio, and ensure your application responds correctly. For example, if you use to receive keypad digits from the caller, Twilio will send a &quot;Digits&quot; parameter to that handler URL indicating what keys were pressed. You could simulate a caller pressing &quot;1&quot; by entering this URL in your browser:&nbsp;<a href="http://my-application.com/my-handler?Digits=1" target="_blank">http://my-application.com/my-<wbr>handler?Digits=1</wbr></a></span></p>
										<h3><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: small;">Scaling Is Easy and Transparent</span></h3>
										<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: small;">Twilio doesn&#39;t limit how many calls you can make or receive at the same time. Many traditional telecom companies charge you for by the &quot;channel&quot; or &quot;trunk&quot;, essentially limiting how many people can interact with your application. We thought that was stupid, so Twilio just charges you per minute for calls, or per-message for SMS... so grow at your own pace and leave the scaling up to us.</span></p>
										<h3><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: small;">We Host the Audio</span></h3>
										<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: small;">When you generate call recordings using the&nbsp;<a href="http://app.streamsend.com/c/13055591/52808/wPDDjEl/UoOO?redirect_to=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.twilio.com%2FRecord" target="_blank">&lt;Record&gt;</a>&nbsp;verb, the resulting recordings are reliably hosted on Twilio&#39;s servers... you never have to worry about storing binary audio on your end, just reference the RecordingUrl in your application. Store the RecordingUrl in your database... Drop it into a&nbsp;<a href="http://app.streamsend.com/c/13055591/52810/wPDDjEl/UoOO?redirect_to=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.twilio.com%2FPlay" target="_blank">&lt;Play&gt;</a>&nbsp;tag in another call... Embed the recording in a webpage as an MP3!</span></p>

<h2><a href="/2010/09/30/switching-to-rvm-ree-nginx-passenger.html">Switching to RVM+REE+NGINX+Passenger</a></h2>
<p>This is the second instalment of my attempt to do a daily post.</p>
<p>We&#39;re increasing the push toward the release, and I&#39;m now spending precious time looking into the why our Rails Stack is *leaking* workers. My initial research suggested that these workers could be sent a SIGABRT to get them to throw a stacktrace and exit - this hasn&#39;t worked however.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been planning to change from the current stack UbuntuProvidedRuby1.8.7+Apache+Passenger to RVM+REE+NGINX+Passenger for a while. With the prerequisite testing done that our app works with the new stack. I&#39;ve decided that rather than attack this problem head-on I&#39;ll use this opportunity to switch and then tackle the problem again if it shows up.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> After changing the stack it appears to have stopped *leaking* workers - that&#39;s a positive outcome to a problem I can&#39;t afford the time to look into in more detail. Additionally the before and after performance tests are in:</p>

<h2><a href="/2010/09/28/daily-stand-up-1.html">Daily Stand Up #1</a></h2>
<p>I&#39;ve made a commitment with myself that I&#39;m going to write blog posts regardless of whether I feel like it or not. I&#39;m going to start by writing the same kind of content that comes up at &quot;Stand Ups&quot; every morning.</p>
<p>For a start my day is currently sliced into working on taking sliced HTML and working it into the Rails app, that our team in currently working on, as themes. It&#39;s giving me an opportunity to exercise my,&nbsp;somewhat rusted,&nbsp;CSS/HTML/JS skills.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve also been spending some time with my operations/admin hat on. Working through the process of making sure that the actual ops team delivers what we need to launch the product. It&#39;s all pretty run-of-the-mill stuff, a more interesting problem is the reliability of using the legacy SQL Server database over a long period of time.</p>
<p>We&#39;ve been seeing errors like &#39;ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid: ODBC::Error: 08S01 (20020) [unixODBC][FreeTDS][SQL Server]Bad token from the server: Datastream processing out of sync&#39; and &#39;ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid: ODBC::Error: S1008 (0) [unixODBC][FreeTDS][SQL Server]Operation was cancelled&#39;</p>
<p>Testing so far has led us to believe that it has something to do with old/invalid connections not being dropped and replaced with new connections.&nbsp;This may or may not have to do with the fact that the connection the SQL Server is done directly on the model(s) rather than through ActiveRecord::Base...which is in turn because we&#39;re storing everything that we can in a MySQL database.</p>
<p>We&#39;ve started working with an already customised version of the activerecord-sqlserver-adapter to improve the way that it handles these errors - by including the error messages in the array of messages that result in a reconnect. Whether this turns out to be an effective solution or not remains to be seen.</p>
