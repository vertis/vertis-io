beast.caboo.se is just loaded with spam.

Which is a shame because it shows the flaws of an otherwise great little application. For those that don’t know beast is a small forum implementation done in ruby on rails, some really nice features in ~500 lines of code. Sadly it doesn’t deal adequately with the realities of the internet. My problem isn’t so much that spam got posted, its that no-one has bothered to clean it off. If you’re going to run a forum you have a responsibility to ensure that it is maintained. If you can’t do it all yourself find some additional volunteers to help moderate the content, or develop a plugin to filter spam.

<strong>UPDATE: </strong>I notified both of them via email, while I recieved a reply from Josh, over 2 months later and still nothing has been done about the spam. Whatever respect I had for <a href="http://www.workingwithrails.com/person/5337-josh-goebel">Josh Grobel</a> and <a href="http://weblog.techno-weenie.net/">Rick Olsen aka Technoweenie</a> is now gone. Josh argued that the forum isn’t used anymore. My response to that would be to delete the spam and lock the forums so you don’t have to deal with it anymore.
