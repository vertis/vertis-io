I've been doing quite a bit of work to get some tools for etsy back online. The original 'etsytools' was forced to close after my girlfriend recieved death threats, not that they could be taken seriously, but it still put a black cloud above an effort that was primarily designed to benefit etsyians. Enough time has passed that I now feel comfortable reviving the site. It won't come back in the same form, if anything I've spent the last six months building tools that will be far more useful than anything I previouslyoffered. As soon as there is a moment to spare from my day job (which keeps me pretty damn busy), I'll polish off the last of the tasks required to get it ready for use.
