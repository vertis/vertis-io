While my internet has been off (its now finally working) I’ve been using a local Network Cafe. They get a bit filled up with junk because they’re not locked down very well, I think limewire is on most if not all of the computers. Now I’m not a big fan of limewire (it has something to do with it always asking you to upgrade to the pro version). Out of curiosity I usually check what other people have been downloading. People download some weird things, my favorite find was a bunch of christian music. If it was you and by some one in a million chance you’re reading this; do me a favor and think about it long and hard. iTunes has PLENTY of christian music you can buy.
