I’m very fond of Eclipse. Sadly the code I’m working on at the moment is mostly C# .net (with at tiny bit of VB), that means I have to adapt to working with Visual Studio. Visual Studio has come a long way since I last used it but I still miss the power that you take for granted when you use eclipse. So I was wondering whether anyone had experimented with the couple of C# plugins for eclipse with anything more than hello world applications.
