I have a lost iPod currently staying with me. It was waiting at the front door when I went down stairs to collect the Thai order that was to be friday nights dinner. There just outside the door on a little ledge was a iPod that looked so lonely and confused. I can only assume that it had wandered away from its owner and then not been sure how to get back. A sign has been placed in the notice board in the lobby since it would seem likely that the owner might walk past that point. If the owner doesn’t then I will have to take more drastic measures to get the iPod home. In the meantime i’m not sure whether I should feed it or not, and if I did feed it would the owner be angry when they got it back or just grateful that I’d taken care of the iPod. Finally should I just feed it mp3s or spoil it with videos?
