<p>I&#39;ve made a commitment with myself that I&#39;m going to write blog posts regardless of whether I feel like it or not. I&#39;m going to start by writing the same kind of content that comes up at &quot;Stand Ups&quot; every morning.</p>
<p>For a start my day is currently sliced into working on taking sliced HTML and working it into the Rails app, that our team in currently working on, as themes. It&#39;s giving me an opportunity to exercise my,&nbsp;somewhat rusted,&nbsp;CSS/HTML/JS skills.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve also been spending some time with my operations/admin hat on. Working through the process of making sure that the actual ops team delivers what we need to launch the product. It&#39;s all pretty run-of-the-mill stuff, a more interesting problem is the reliability of using the legacy SQL Server database over a long period of time.</p>
<p>We&#39;ve been seeing errors like &#39;ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid: ODBC::Error: 08S01 (20020) [unixODBC][FreeTDS][SQL Server]Bad token from the server: Datastream processing out of sync&#39; and &#39;ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid: ODBC::Error: S1008 (0) [unixODBC][FreeTDS][SQL Server]Operation was cancelled&#39;</p>
<p>Testing so far has led us to believe that it has something to do with old/invalid connections not being dropped and replaced with new connections.&nbsp;This may or may not have to do with the fact that the connection the SQL Server is done directly on the model(s) rather than through ActiveRecord::Base...which is in turn because we&#39;re storing everything that we can in a MySQL database.</p>
<p>We&#39;ve started working with an already customised version of the activerecord-sqlserver-adapter to improve the way that it handles these errors - by including the error messages in the array of messages that result in a reconnect. Whether this turns out to be an effective solution or not remains to be seen.</p>
