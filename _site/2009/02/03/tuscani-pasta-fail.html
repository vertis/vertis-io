I don't pretend to be a marketing expert, but every so often when I'm watching the TV in the evening I get a sickly taste in my mouth. A tragic advertisement will flash briefly across the screen pushing me to buy something or trying to enhance a brand name. Currently, that ad is one for a new range of pasta from Pizza Hut. I'm going to break my objections into two halves; the advertisement &amp; the product.
<h3>The Advertisement</h3>
The ad starts with people eating dinner at a restaurant called 'Tuscani'. They have hidden cameras much as you would find in a restaurant show like Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares. All to make it seem like it's a real restaurant. After the people have discussed convienently enough how creamy and excellent the pasta is, the chef(?) comes out and announces that he has a confession to make; He didn't cook anything tonight it was all delivered by Pizza Hut. At this point the <a href="http://www.pizzahut.com.au">Pizza Hut</a> people have appeared with 'The Product'. There is delighted surprise &amp; and applause. You can find the copy I found on <a title="YouTube.com" href="http://youtube.com">youtube</a> below (<strong>NB: The version below is slightly different than the Australian version, with a different chef &amp; people, and different restaurant location).</strong>

Here is how the advertisement fails:
<ol>
	<li>People don't like being deceived - The restaurant is not real and therefore your ad is based on a lie.</li>
	<li>People don't react like that when deceived - Pull that kind of stunt in real life and people would be walking out and/or demanding the meal for free. *If* the ad were based on real events you've just defrauded 20-50 people out of their money.</li>
	<li>No self respecting chef would (a) allow that to happen in his restaurant and (b) confess that to his customers - it would be a sure way to bankrupt your business.</li>
	<li>You don't have enough range for people to believe they are ordering from a restaurant menu (3 types over there, 2 here) - You can't honestly make me believe EVERYBODY in the restaurant just happened to want the type of pasta that the tuscani range offers.</li>
</ol>
On the above note let me move on to ripping a hole in the product itself.
<h3><strong>The Product</strong></h3>
<ol>
	<li>As mentioned above there are only 2 to 3 different options when it comes to the pastas you can get from pizza hut, this is a pitiful offering considering the fact that there are half a dozen 'Pasta Pantry' franchises sprinkled across the Sydney CBD and the range offered is outstanding(~20 different pasta dishes + salads, soups &amp; other items).</li>
	<li>A recent study found that pasta is the commonly eaten dish, fine, I can see how someone high up in pizza hut could want to include pasta in the menu - <strong>which results in a big FAIL for you my friend</strong>. Pasta is a common dish because it is probably the easiest thing in the world to cook short of boiling an egg or putting bread in the toaster.</li>
	<li>Besides being super simple to make, it is also a staple in most diets because it is cheap enough to be affordable even on the tightest of budgets.</li>
	<li>There is no vegetarian option. How <strong>FRACKING</strong> hard do you think it is to offer a vegetarian option (sorry, pet hate)</li>
</ol>
<h3>Conclusions</h3>
The Tuscani Pasta commercial is an epic fail.

The product: not cheap, not flexible and has a lousy range.

The commercial: dishonest, unrealistic and poorly conceived

<strong>EPIC FAIL</strong>
