It's been almost a month since my last post, disgraceful. While I have the will to maintain a blog, I certainly don't have the time. We're currently in the thick of a large Documentum deployment, which means that there are bucket loads of new users that each have their own issues with the system. 

I have learned SO much over the last few months, hopefully I'll have a chance to sit down over the next week or so and distill some of that wisdom. Until then, keep safe.
