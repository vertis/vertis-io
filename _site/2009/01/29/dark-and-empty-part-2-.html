It's late (or very very early). The heat from today has finally gone, though its still muggy and sweaty. I'll post a picture of the view from the back of the apartment block when I get the chance. Why would you be reading this anyway, I don't have any great pearls of wisdom like <a title="randsinrepose" href="http://randsinrepose.com" target="_blank">randsinrepose</a>, and I certainly don't have a fascinating life jetting around the world, riding a web 2.0 wave.

Nope, I'm just me. I'm a hacker, or so I like to think, the white hat variety if you want to classify me further. I spend countless hours writing code in a variety of languages, and perhaps I'll share some of that here.Â 

No, what I am is a man in his late twenties who is struggling to find balance and purpose...beyond that of just surviving. I watch as people get rich in the industry around me and wonder where I went wrong. Not that anything is drastically wrong, but I'm not making a bucket load of money or solving all the worlds problems either. I haven't created any great and wonderous technologies that I can be proud of.

I am dark and empty. I'm looking to build, and expand - to learn and to excel. This is certainly not the first time I've blogged. But it is a new beginning. A lot of what I would like to accomplish is to learn to put words on paper again. I'm no poet or author but I do have stories to tell and questions to ask.

Enough for now, I have to sleep and then get up and go to work. One more day.
