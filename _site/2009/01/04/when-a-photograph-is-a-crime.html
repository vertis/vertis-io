In my afternoon break I've been reading about a photographer that was arrested and charged for taking photographs at Penn Station in New York. You can read about it on <a href="http://carlosmiller.com/2008/12/27/amtrak-police-arrest-photographer-participating-in-amtrak-photo-contest/">Carlos Millers</a> blog.

I've been following the Australian Internet Censorship debate pretty closely, and this is another issue that while on the other side of the world distresses me.

I've taken photos at train stations numerous times without incident. Hell I've taken photos at (domestic) airport terminals without problems.But thats out here, where we haven't been touched quite so much by terrorism. Sure we came along for the ride in Afganistan and Iraq (like any good ally will). But we've not had the world appear to end above our heads (or quite likely at eye level since I'm sitting in a skyscrapper right now). I understand where someone on the other side of the fence is coming from...its simpler if noone takes photos.

What the Amtrak police did was make a presumption of guilt. Wielding a camera makes you a terrorist (because thats what terrorists do). It is beside the point that you've got credibility (veteran/ticket/contest) when they scratch the surface, there is now an environment of paranoia about terrorist attacks. The sad thing is that it means that the terrorist attacks have been successful, they have instilled terror into the hearts of Americans.
