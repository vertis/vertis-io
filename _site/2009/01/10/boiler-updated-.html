A while ago (right after Rails Rumble) I decided to rework Bort to suit my own tastes. I renamed my Bort derived rails base app to Boiler. Yesterday I went through and reworked Boiler from a newer copy of Bort. I added a more inviting default theme and some of the other plugins and gems that I use regularly.
