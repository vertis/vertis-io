  title: "Getting started Twitter"
  ---

I've avoided using twitter for quite a while (for who knows what reason). But I finally relented and signed up for an account while I was looking for good ruby and rails blogs to follow and stumbled across a post that had a complete list of famous Ruby people (Rubyists). I have to say that so far I haven't been disappointed with it.

It reminds me a lot of IRC but without the having to join lots of channels and check all of them for discussions (when mostly their idle with spurts of discussion). I've wanted to be more involved with the ruby and rails social aspect since I took part in Rails Rumble 2008.

I will be interesting to see how my usage of twitter evolves over time.
