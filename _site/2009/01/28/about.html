<p><meta charset="utf-8" />I&#39;ve now moved into full time Ruby on Rails development. I still bring my experience in Document Management and Enterprise solutions to bear on problems. I&#39;m practicing Agile development in my new role (and loving it).</p>
<p>I now live in Erskineville which is not quite as close to the city, but has awesome parks and is close to the great culture of Newtown.</p>
<p><strike>I work as a Document Management Consultant. I do a little bit of development in my spare time, mostly using Ruby, though I&#39;ve been known to use everything from Java to Python. I live in Darlinghurst, which is a stone&#39;s throw from the Sydney CBD (very handy) and spitting distant to Kings Cross (not so handy).</strike></p>
