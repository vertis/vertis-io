One of the things fast approaching for the southern hemisphere is the time of year that everybody breaks for Christmas Holidays. The northern hemisphere would be more familiar with the concept of summer holidays. The only difference really is that we mix our summer holidays with Christmas celebrations, and go to the beach on boxing day. All that aside, most firms close down for a few weeks, until mid January, and staff are forced to take part of their 4 weeks annual leave (whether they want to or not).

I'm sitting here now mulling over an email asking me to submit my holiday leave form, stating that I am indeed taking the mandatory days off, as leave.
