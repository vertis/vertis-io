I read with interest your recent article on <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-lynton/guardrails-for-the-intern_b_207459.html">huffingtonpost.com</a>. With respect I have to say that you're barking up the wrong tree with your desire to regulate the internet, that is what you're proposing, despite claiming its not about "censorship, taxation or burdensome government restrictions" there is a clear desire to regulate the internet. I'm here to tell you that its just not technically possible. The best you could hope for is to push piracy deeper, to sue or convict anyone that downloads a movie or mp3 illegally, which is not practical.

How long do you think a government is going to be able to maintain locking up people for downloading illegal content, or process the volume or cases that would be needed to pull off being deterred from downloading content. This is not even broaching the subject of connecting an IP to a person, there are literally hundred's of internet cafes walking distance from where I live.

I would say that everything about your article screams old media, for a start there is no such thing as 'Store Hours', it's just one symptom of not understanding how fundamentally the internet has changed the landscape. This:
<blockquote>I ran an Internet company and my studio actively uses the web to market and sell our movies and television shows. We create original content for new media.</blockquote>
is another example of where you're missing the point.
