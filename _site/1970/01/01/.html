I have not been so enthused for a while, not since I started work on rewriting a Documentum / Lotus Notes integration mid last year. Part of the excitement is just starting a new project, after all I'm a developer at heart.

The project that I'm prototyping currently has to be one of the coolest things ever, migrating several hundred million documents from one content management system. We're talking over 20TB of files, plus the need to convert/create the content(database records, etc) in the new content management system. It's exciting because the sheer scale of what's required means you get to play with Architecture for the final environment, and design the migration utility to be robust (unlike the usual migration tools lying around)
