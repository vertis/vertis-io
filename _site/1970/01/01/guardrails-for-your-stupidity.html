Michael Lynton just doesn't get it. The Chariman &amp; CEO of Sony Pictures Entertainment could not be further from the mark. After the uproar he caused by saying "I'm a guy who sees nothing good having come from the Internet. Period.". He has written an <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-lynton/guardrails-for-the-intern_b_207459.html">article</a> on <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com">huffingtonpost.com
</a>, to supposedly make his larger point- that the internet needs to be curtailed and brought to order. 

There is nothing practical about Michael Lynton's beliefs and desires. You can dislike piracy on the internet all you like but the only thing you'll be able to do is push it deeper.
