## Mentoring

I am happy to provide mentoring on a variety of subjects. I prefer bi-directional mentoring, which means we find something that you can teach me as well. There are always things to learn and to teach. As above, reach out.

## Consulting

In addition to my work on my startup, I also spend at part of my time consulting across a variety of domains. I have 20 years of tech experience. 

Consulting is a catch-all term. It can mean speaking engagements, working to up-skill an internal team, building a rapid prototype and/or bringing an app to market. 

Some of the areas I can help:

- Augmented Reality
- Virtual Reality
- Lean/Agile in Emerging Technologies
- Rapid Prototyping
- Innovation/disruption in the real estate industry

I enjoy pushing the boundaries of technology and inventing ways of solving problems with emerging technology. If you're interested in engaging my services don't hesitate to get contact using the details above.

If I'm not available for the work, I also have a strong network that I can refer you to.
