      <p class="text-xl text-gray-500 leading-8">I'm a Kiwi-born software engineer and entrepreneur. My current focus is working on <a href="https://twirrl.co">Twirrl</a>, a tool to help online retailers showcase their products more effectively using 360Â° spins (still under development).</p>
      <p>Before going off to found my own company, I worked for <a href="http://realestate.com.au">realestate.com.au</a> as the co-founder and lead engineer for REALABS. The team responsible for bringing emerging technology into the business.</p>
      <p>While leading REALABS, the team was responsible for introducing 3D scanning into the Australian property market and releasing a world-first VR property portal, creatively named realestateVR.</p>
      <p>I spent a lot of time presenting to Real Estate agents about disruption and innovation and helping them take their first steps to transform their businesses.</p>

      <p>I'm a keen student of agile and lean. I'm passionate about challenging teams not to just build blindly without first establishing product market fit.</p>
      <p>I'm also digital nomad. I've spent the last two years visiting ~40 countries. As I write this I am sitting in an office in Tallinn watching the first snow of the year fall.</p>
