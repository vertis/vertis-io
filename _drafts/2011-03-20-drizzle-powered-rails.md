title: "Drizzle powered Rails"

With the first GA release of [drizzle](http://drizzle.org) on Friday it's high time there was a tutorial about how to get Rails running on top of [drizzle](http://drizzle.org).

You can install drizzle from homebrew if you're using a mac, and there are packages for most linux distributions.
