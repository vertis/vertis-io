My networks for the last 8 or so years are very centered around the company that I work for [REA Group](http://www.rea-group.com). This is fine. It's an great company to work for, with great people.

As with a lot of companies recently they have made the jump from IRC, a medium that didn't really record a long history, to Slack.

But if I zoom out my digital communication is incredibly fragmented and in a lot of ways I don't feel like I'm being effective and connected in the way that I should be. Lets do a stocktake of the ways I communicate:

## Twitter
Mostly sharing links and retweeting interesting things. I don't feel like I get good value out of my feed any more.

I don't tend to read it a lot any more, and while I might get into some short conversations using this as a medium, I don't for the most part feel that this connects me very well. Twitter conflates connecting and following. It's impossible to not end up with a firehose if you follow reciprocally, as I do, a large number of people.

Fine tuning and curating this feed feels increasingly like too much effort. Throw in unavoidable promoted tweets on the mobile app and I just find it hard to ignore.

## Skype
So Skype, I loved it for a while, but now I almost never sign into it. I tried for a while things like having it on my phone, but I found it incrediby clunky and horrible. It's not a useful tool when it doesn't want to travel with me.

## Whatsapp
Used it for a while. Not entirely certain why it fell out of favour, a few of my contacts use it, but for the most part it's not a part of the way I communicate.

## Telegram
I'm not sure why I started using Telegram. I pretty much only use it with my girlfriend. A few other people have signed up for it, but for the most part no-one else actually messages me on this platform.

## Facebook (and Facebook Messenger)
I should have completely opted out of Facebook, but I haven't.

Let's list all the ways facebook doesn't do what I need.
  - Yet again, not really in control of my network.
  - Wants all the communication to come through the network
  - All the people on it are not really the people that I'm interested in talking to (childhood connections). It's nothing against them, but we don't have much in common now.
  - I don't have any way of separating them into groups. If it is supported then it's not something that I know how to do.

## Snapchat
I was late to Snapchat and if there were ever people in my network that use Snapchat, I'm not connected to them. I quite like it as a platform, but without contacts I'll never really end up using it.

## LinkedIn
Arguably this should be the the most useful for the "work/interest network" that I was thinking about above. But it's not engineered that way. It's basically a ghost town of recruiter emails and occasional connections from colleagues and people that I will be dealing with.

Somewhere hidden in the site is the ability interact with groups and publish content. I'm not sure where.

Also, it's a closed system. In no way can I get a good understanding of my network and how to expand it in ways that are useful. It's not a system for engineers, and it's not something I feel in control of.

## Slack (Work)
Work Slack is incredible. Rich content. Great discussions, and channels. Sometimes information overload.

Problems:
  - Not mine, when I leave it's all gone
  - No real ability to bring external contacts into the network

## Slack (VRTK)
One of the other Slack groups I'm in is the VRTK Slack. It's often super interesting and there is a rich set of information. Unfortunately because it's free that information is ephemeral. Disappearing forever after the 10k messages.

## Email (Work & Personal)
## Signal
I've been burned by Signal before. I had it on my phone and didn't backup conversations only to have them get lost. The secure features are a great idea in theory, but in practice it's just another place that people don't seem to want to have a conversation.

Constantly asking me to move someone from SMS to Encrypted chat is beyond annoying.

## Riot.im (Matrix)
This is okay, and interesting as a form of communication, but it's in it infancy. A lot of the channels are still ghost towns.

## Discord
Strangely a lot of my recent interesting discussions have happened ons
## Keybase
