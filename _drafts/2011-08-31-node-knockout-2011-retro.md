title: "Node Knockout 2011 Retro"
---
This weekend gone I _competed_, if you can call it that in Node Knockout 2011. I should start with a disclaimer that I'm not a javascript programmer, and while I've dabbled with node.js before (and fixed the odd problem with javascript), by and large in the paste I've treated javascript as a second class language. It's something that I've been meaning to remedy, and participating in Node Knockout is one of the ways of chosen to do that.
 
Before all the lessons fade away, I've decided to document the experience in an agile retrospective style. 

*The Bad*
 - Got distracted during the weekend.
 - Wasted a lot of time on things I didn't know. 
 - Didn't get the app finished.
 
*The Good*
 - Learned a lot about node.js and javascript in general
 - Researched and started to understand the google reader api
 - Used backbone.js and a bunch of other front end javascript libraries for the first time.
 - Used MongoDb from node.js

*Puzzles Me*
 - Lack of decent stack traces in javascript
